# Kotlin Wasm and About this blog technology
## What is Kotlin Wasm?
It is one of the targets provided in Kotlin Multiplatform. Previously, when building web applications with Kotlin Multiplatform, Kotlin/JS was the only choice. However, a new alternative has been developed called Kotlin/Wasm.

Despite being in the early stages of development, Kotlin/Wasm has shown superior performance compared to Kotlin/JS. This is evident in its usage in Compose for Web, where Kotlin/Wasm has been employed.
